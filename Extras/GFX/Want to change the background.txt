In the folder "502 Coloured" there are Gif's which are saved ready for being split.
There are also Pre-Split images since I know some people will be lazy or it may not work.



In the folder "Photoshop files" the original photoshop files are there if you would like to edit them.
I give anyone permission to edit the images and post them where ever just dont claim you
made 100% of it.


In the folder "PNG" is PNG files of the images, for what ever reason. Maybe you want them
as a desktop background :)
