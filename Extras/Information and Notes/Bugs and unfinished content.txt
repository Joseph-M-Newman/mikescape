EXV1 Released "Unfinished content"
---------------------------------------
-Unfinished-
	-Heal other spell - unfinished, was curious if i could get it working when making crumble undead.
	-Oger Games minigame - was a thieving skiller based minigame which players could steal from the coffins and sometimes an ogre may appear. you would eventually find a key which would unlock the bosses tomb where you could either fight him or use skills for the reward.
	-Crystal key chest - Was a basic piece of new content i threw in when i originaly ran my server so it wasnt developed at all.
	-Lucien Boss - havnt added the drops yet, was thinking of doing high cash reward and possible korasi
	-The random event on the thieving stall doesnt work 100% but still stops autoclickers. I just never understood how to work interfaces when i coded it so it wasnt finished.
	-Troll queen and DKS not finished, drops havnt been added.
	-DKS isnt multi yet.need to get the area coords for the DKS and add it to the multi list.
	-Dagonoth prime has jacked up attacks its pretty funny :P i make it like that though
	-Construction guide. My method of construction was very complex in a way, it involved a lot of different combinations which i was going to make more profitable the higher your level																																							^^

-Bugs-
	-Sometimes the Ge prices do not always match the trade prices. I have recently found out its because of my shop.java item price method, or atleast i think it is. Its because economy prices is the default and i have changed methods therefore the ge checks economyprices.to set teh prices right you need to check the sell value in a shop so left click an item when a shop is open. this si for chaotics and most items in the ss1 and nonex i think.
	-the odd time nearing th end of running my server i noticed bandos didnt always respawn this was not very often maybe every month or so, btu to fi it just restart server.
	-Occasianal noclip can happen. this means your player moves 1-2 tiles of thier real position. you may see yourself wal through walls yet nobody else sees it. to fi just relog.
	-pets dont disapeer if you logout. never bothered trying to fix this since i dont see much point in pets to be honest. 
	-"cast" doesnt work on most ancient spells. never knew why.
	-Sort of a bug but not really, anyone with any right higher than player i think needs to use developer console or ;;. this comes with custom rights and havnt figured out how to fix it yet.
	-Sometimes when you type a command you get the message sent twice. In short, i dont know how to fix and havnt tried since i dont think it makes much of a difference/problem.
	
	
	*Note*
	There may be more bugs and are some other things that are unfinished or may not work properly 
	which i forgot about.
