my commands are based on the custom right tutorial by someone called Ifi, i think thats thier name.
Its skightly different as now there are 12 rights rather than 4. its still the same layout basicly


each set of rights is marked out by the //Name at the start so for example owner will have //Owner
at the beginning and //Mod is commands for mods. 

Whoever has there lot of commands the highest up will be able to use any command that is under it
so for example if we have something below.....


//Owner

if cmd = "Ban"{
Ban}


//Mod

if cmd = "teleto"


the owner can still use the command "teleto" even though its listed under a mod command. this is
because the owner is higher up in the lines than mod and can use any command under him. This goes for
all rights. the setright can use any command listed below it.
