Disabled Features:
--------------------

Player Online/Ingame SQL updater.
-----------------------------------
Look in SQL.Java, Worldthread.java, and Player.Java



In SQL.java edit the database information to match your SQL Database.

Worldthread.Java, search for "//Players ingame count." and uncomment the big block.

In Player.java, search for "//Highscores" and uncomment that code.








Staffpin Server Security
--------------------------

Normally all Mods+ will need to enter a custom pin number to use thier mod+ commands.
However since new RSPS owners wont understand it I have removed it.

To re-enable this feature you will need to look in Player.java

Search for "//Staffpin Disabled" and read the instructions there.

To make a new pin, do ;;staffpin 0 to unlock the commands. then do ::Setstaffpin (pin number)
