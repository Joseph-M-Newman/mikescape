Do not use the grand exchange. Unless you fix it people can dupe on it.

This is because the noting system just gets the next id after the normal items id. 

Some items noted form is not the next id. 

An example of this is if you buy 100 adamant claws, you will get a full inventory of rune claws.
This is because the adamant claws id is 3100 the noted form should be 3101 but that is the id of rune claws instead.

so when you pay for adamant claws it will give you rune claws instead.
