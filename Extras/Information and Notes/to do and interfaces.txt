To do:
-------

when reaches say 50 charges he does a 1 hit ko.

Add packs: rtocktail, sara brew, super restore. 
6m 10k rocks, 2.1m 5k super restore, 1.25m for 5k brews

DZ:
	add a magic tree ivy style:
		object 10535349 



- planning on adding a "donator chest" Like C Key chest, except every 24 hours donators can open it for a random prize. Wont be large but still not pointless.
- Working on a small "Minigame", where you grind wheat for points or kill enchanted spades, cos Yolo, to get special items, such as grain sack, Nigel Pet/stance and a potential new weapon, which im sure not everyone will approve of..... The Spade Blade! 
- Also will be adding pets for donators in the next few weeks as well. ( May release a few F2P pets. But dont want them to be overloaded)
